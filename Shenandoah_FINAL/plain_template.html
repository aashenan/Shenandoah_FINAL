    Spilling a couple gallons of gasoline in your yard may seem like no big deal, but the environmental impacts could be much bigger than you think.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Each year, New York State estimates <a href= "https://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8428.html">16,000 reports of petroleum and chemical spills in the state</a>. The Spill Response Program, run by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), is responsible for overseeing the containment and proper disposal of petroleum products when a spill is reported. Both Federal and NY State law requires spills to be reported to the agency as soon as possible. The longer one delays in reporting a contamination, the greater the negative impact on the environment is. 
</p>

 <p>
  Oil spills can have drastic environmental impacts on plants, animals, and people. If not properly cleaned up in time, petroleum can seep through soil, potentially contaminating groundwater, drinking water, and of course the soil itself. 
 </p>


 <p> 
  Left uncontained, spilled petroleum can have many harmful effects on the environment and public health. Spilled oil can contaminate bodies of water, making lakes and rivers dangerous to swim in and fish at, as well as posing a significant hazard to wildlife. Large amounts of oil spilled in water bodies can affect the way <a href= "https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-01/documents/ospguide99.pdf">fish</a> reproduce for generations, even after the spill is cleaned up, making it difficult for commercial fisheries to generate income, as well as possibly dangerous for people to consume the affected fish. 
 </p>

 <p> 
  Oil spills on <a href= "https://www.oilspillprevention.org/oil-spill-cleanup/land-oil-spill-cleanup"> land</a> can impact plant growth and health. The presence of oil in soil can reduce water filtration, negatively impacting plant growth and has the potential to any form of agriculture impossible if left unaddressed.
 </p>


 <p> 
  Both Federal and New York state laws dictate that petroleum spills must be reported to the DEC within two hours of the initial incident unless:

1.  The spill is less than five gallons
2.  The spill is contained and under control
3.  The spill has not reached and will not reach state water bodies or land
4.  The spill is cleaned up within two hours

 </p>

 <p>
   The DEC considers petroleum spills that occur on concrete, asphalt, or other paved surfaces to not have impacted land and do not need to be reported unless they are at risk of reaching land.

 <p>
   <a href= "https://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8692.html">MTBE is an octane enhancing additive sometimes used in gasoline.</a> Although the import and the sale of gasoline containing MTBE has been banned in New York state since 2004, contamination issues can still be a problem. The additive MTBE increases the speed with which gasoline seeps through the ground if spilled, as well as dissolves into groundwater more quickly than the petroleum, resulting in the potential to move greater distance from the initial spill site. 
 </p>

 <p>
   When drinking water is contaminated with MTBE, the water gets a distinctively bad taste and smell and could cause adverse health effects in both humans and animals. It’s important to contact the local Health Department or the New York State Department of Health if a contamination of MTBE is suspected in the water supply.  
 </p>

 <p>
   Over time, multiple small spills can add up if they are not dealt with properly. This can cause groundwater contamination, leading to drinking water contamination. 
 </p>

 <p>
   Cleaning up a large oil spill can be expensive. According to the DEC, those responsible for the spill are legally obligated to pay for the cleanup process. However, the DEC is able to fund the cleaning process of a major oil spill through the "New York Environmental Protection and Spill Compensation Fund" or the "Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund," but they will seek out the responsible party for compensation and to pay any possible fines.

   What can you do to help?
 </p>

 <p>
   <a href= "https://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/32266.html">The New York state DEC recommends</a> checking once a month for leaks in your fuel tanks, engines, or fuel storage containers and finding proper ways to dispose of old or unusable gasoline and petroleum products. Checking with your local town for a proper way of disposing of hazardous waste is necessary to eliminate as much pollution as possible.
 </p>

 <p>
   The DEC also recommends storing gasoline and all other hazardous chemicals downhill from well systems and other bodies of drinking water to avoid a chance of contamination.
